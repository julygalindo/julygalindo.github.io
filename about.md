Hello! Thank you for stopping by! 

I am a Colombian lawyer and have dedicated my career to law and public policy in technology and privacy. I spent 10+ years practicing law in the law firm world. I´ve had the opportunity to participate in technology`s complex legal matters, and in public policy sectorial conversations and actions related to digital technologies. Nowadays, I am an independent scholar and consultant in Law and Public Policy in Emerging Technologies. Through the @portmydata initiative (EU and UK work for now!) we are researching the right to data portability in Emerging Technologies, so if you are interested, check out our most recent publication in that field: ¨The exercisability of the right to data portability in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) environment¨[New Media & Society Publication](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1461444820934033)

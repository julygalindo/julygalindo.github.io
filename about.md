about: ### Hello! Thank you for stopping by! 

I am a Colombian lawyer and have dedicated my career to law and public policy in technology and privacy. I spent 10+ years practicing law in the law firm world. I've had the opportunity to participate in technology's complex legal matters, and in public policy sectorial conversations and actions related to digital technologies. 

Nowadays, I am an independent scholar and consultant in Law and Public Policy in Emerging Technologies. Through the @portmydata initiative (EU and UK work for now!) we are researching the right to data portability in Emerging Technologies, so if you are interested, check out our most recent publication in that field: "The exercisability of the right to data portability in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) environment" [New Media & Society Publication](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1461444820934033).

Follow @portmydata on Twitter and stay tuned for more work on data portability in emerging tech!


### More Information

Colombian and latin to my bones, and deeply proud of it. I believe in the great impact diversity brings to technology's design, deployment and dialogue. I trust from wherever I stand from I will be able to contribute to technology for all and to its greater good. Technology is neutral, and I command to that principle. Reflection and conversations around its dual use are needed, specially in a moment when as society we are not able to envision the potential of many emerging digital technologies. 

UC Berkeley -once a bear, always a bear!- LL.M graduate, and MPA in Public Policy and Digital Technologies from University College London -London, my love-. Huge plus, lawyer from Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia. The University that served as a source of inspiration to staying curious, viewing the world beyond territorial borders, and to question the status quo.

Gratitude always. If only we had more of it. Even during covid times.
